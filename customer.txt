                    ######## Customer Segmentation ###########
''' In this file , we give the brief introduction of this project for better understanding'''

''' A good understanding of customers is extremely important for running a succesful business
   KYC or 'Know Your Customer' is what actually makes all the difference for many companies.
   KYC helps them do their best in Creating Communicating, and delivering their offerings
   by tailoring them to their customer's needs. and that make customer analytics the most
   important part of both marketing analytics and the marketing function of a company in general.
   But understanding and meeting customers needs is easier said than done . in fact , customer
   Analytics is a very broad area. It may include a wide range of characterstics of customers
    and their behaviour and numerouos different outcomes and performance indicators that 
    the business might be interested in.
'''

'''In this project we use one the most fundamental marketing frameworks that of segmenattion ,, targeting
 and positioning, known as the 'S T P framework'.

 The 'S T P framework' is the most logical choice, as it applies to all areas of business
 and marketing activites . The datasets that we'll work with come from a B-2-C business model.
 This means that the clients of our business are individual pepole rather than firms or institutions.
 And that'ss much better from data science point of view, as we usually have more data points.'''

     ######### STP framework ###############
     It lays out the classical process of exploring potential customers and understanding them.
     The 'S T P framework ' consists of 3 consecutive steps:
       1) s for segmenation 
       2) T for targeting
       3) P for positioning

     1) Segmentation : Segmentation is the process of dividing a population of potential or existing
      customers into groups that share similar characterstics. The underlying idea is that, most likely
      these groups will have comparable purchase behaviours. Furthermore, these segments would
      probably respond similarly to different marketing activites.
